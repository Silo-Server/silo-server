# Backups

`internal/backup` takes whole-server backups: a `pg_dump` of the database plus
the blobs that cannot be fetched again. It lists, rotates, and deletes them,
and the `silo backup` command restores one in full. The endpoints are in
[backups-api.md](../backups-api.md).

A backup is a recovery point for this server's own data. It does not include
media files (Silo never manages them, see [non-goals](../non-goals.md)),
rebuildable data (provider artwork, chapter images, trickplay, Redis,
Meilisearch, transcode and download folders), `SECRET_KEY`, `.env`, or
Compose files. It is not point-in-time recovery; deployments that need that
archive WAL at the PostgreSQL layer.

Backups refuse to run on the SQLite user store (`userdb.backend=sqlite`): a
backup must never claim to be complete without user data. The message is
"Backups need the PostgreSQL user store. Import your SQLite user store first."

## Layout

Each backup is one folder at the destination:

```
backups/<server-id>/<UTC time>-<kind>/
  db.dump          pg_dump custom format, zstd level 3
  blobs.tar        assets/<key> and operational/<key> entries
  manifest.json    written last
```

- `server-id` is `server.identity_id` (`internal/serveridentity`). Every server
  writes and rotates only its own prefix; other prefixes at the destination
  are listed by id and otherwise left alone.
- The folder name is the backup id: `20261031T040000.123Z-nightly`. The time
  is the start of the run in UTC, to the millisecond; ids written to the
  second (`20261031T040000Z-nightly`) still parse. Kinds are `nightly`,
  and `manual`. Names that do not parse,
  such as a full restore's `<time>-overwritten-blobs`, are never treated as
  backups.
- **A folder is never reused.** A backup reserves its id under the subsystem
  lock from the folders at the destination, complete or not and of any kind:
  a time a folder already has (two runs in one millisecond, or a clock that
  went back) moves on a millisecond until it is free (`reserveID`). Every
  folder's time is therefore distinct, which keeps rotation's newest-first
  order total. "Back up now" reserves the id before it answers, under the lock
  the run inherits, so the id it returns is the folder written.
- **A folder without `manifest.json` is incomplete.** The manifest is the last
  object written, so its presence is the commit point. Listing shows an
  incomplete folder as `in_progress` only while the published active
  operation (see [Status](#status)) is that backup, and `incomplete`
  otherwise. The sweep deletes incomplete folders whose name and newest
  object are both older than 24 hours.

### Manifest

`manifest.json` has `format: "silo-backup"` and `version: 1`. Readers accept
every version up to theirs and refuse a newer one. It records the id, kind,
server id, start and completion times, Silo version, goose version (the
highest applied `goose_db_version`), `applied_migrations` (every applied
goose version, ascending, without goose's version 0; it must end at the goose
version), PostgreSQL server version, `pg_dump`
version, the tables whose data was excluded, each object's size and the
SHA-256 of its stored bytes, the `SECRET_KEY` check value, how the table of contents was checked, the blob count and bytes,
`missing_blobs`, and the core table inventory. The objects are exactly
`db.dump` and `blobs.tar`.

The inventory covers `users`, `user_profiles`, `media_folders`, `media_items`,
`media_files`, `server_settings`, `plugin_installations`,
`library_collections`, `user_watch_history`, and `user_watch_progress`. Each
is "present" with a row count or "absent", checked with `to_regclass` in the
backup's snapshot, so an older schema without a table records "absent"
instead of failing. A full restore compares the restored database with it,
presence and counts both.

Status is `complete` when every referenced blob was copied and
`complete_with_warnings` when some were missing. "Complete" means the manifest
exists, checksums are recorded, and `pg_restore --list` read the table of
contents. It does not claim the backup was restored; `silo backup verify` is
the drill for that.

The check value is HKDF-SHA256 over `SECRET_KEY` with info
`silo/backup-key-check/v1`, 8 bytes, written as 16 hex digits in groups of 4
(`secret.KeyCheckValue`, beside the data key derivation in
`internal/secret/cipher.go`). `silo secret check` reads a key on stdin and
prints the value, so an operator can tell which key a backup needs without
showing either key.

## Taking a backup

1. Preflight: the user store is PostgreSQL, the destination exists, its id
   is reserved, `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` are installed, and the destination
   has free space of at least 1.5 times the previous
   backup plus 1 GB. The default destination shares a disk with the database,
   and filling it would take PostgreSQL down.
2. Open a `REPEATABLE READ`, read-only transaction and call
   `pg_export_snapshot()`. In the same transaction read the server and schema
   versions, the table inventory, and the referenced blob keys.
3. Run `pg_dump --format=custom --compress=zstd:3 --snapshot=<id>` with
   `--exclude-table-data-and-children` for `activity_log`, `operational_logs`,
   `policy_decisions`, `catalog_search_index_events`, `backup_status` (its row
   describes the backup being taken), and, unless
   `backup.include_intro_fingerprints`, `media_intro_fingerprints`. The schema
   is always dumped. The password moves from the URL into `PGPASSWORD` so it
   never appears in a process listing.
4. Stream `pg_dump`'s stdout straight into the destination with no local
   spool, hashing the stored bytes. `pg_restore --list` reads a tee of the
   stream. `pg_restore` reads a custom-format archive's table of contents
   from a pipe and exits without reading the data; the tee then drops its copy
   and the upload continues. If the piped check fails, the check reads the
   stored object back. The manifest records which happened (`pipe` or
   `read_back`).
5. Close the snapshot transaction and copy the blobs into `blobs.tar`.
6. Write the manifest, then rotate and sweep. A failure in any earlier step
   leaves an incomplete folder and deletes nothing.

Missing fingerprints are safe to leave out: existing markers live elsewhere,
and intro detection recomputes a season's fingerprints only when the season's
input signature changes, for example when a new episode arrives.

### Blobs

Blob keys come from the snapshot's references, never from listing the store:

| Source | Store |
|---|---|
| Item, season, episode, and person artwork whose source is `upload://` (`metadata.UploadedArtworkColumns`) | assets |
| Admin collection posters and backdrops, personal collection posters | assets |
| Library posters (`media_folders.poster_path`) | assets |
| Branding assets (`branding.*_ref` settings, `branding.AssetObjectKey`) | assets |
| Uploaded profile avatars (`user_profiles.avatar` starting `upload:`) | operational |
| Downloaded subtitles (`downloaded_subtitles.s3_key`), unless `backup.include_subtitles` is off | assets |

For an artwork original (`.../original[.<revision>].<ext>`) the copy also
takes the stored variants of the same revision in its directory. Only the
referenced key itself is required.

A backup carries only keys in these namespaces: `local/` (uploaded item
artwork is cached as library artwork), `collection-images/`,
`user-collection-images/`, `library-posters/`, `branding/`, and `subtitles/`
in the assets store, and `profile-avatars/` in the operational store. A
reference outside them (provider artwork a collection borrows, for example)
can be fetched again and is not copied. Nothing under `backups/` is ever a
blob a backup carries.

Blobs are copied after the snapshot closes, so the copy is not frozen with it.
A key replaced in place (library posters, some collection images) may carry
bytes newer than the snapshot. A referenced key can be deleted during the
backup: superseded collection image revisions and replaced downloaded
subtitles are deleted immediately, and only derived media images go through
the delayed `blob_gc_queue`. No delay is guaranteed for the blobs a backup
copies. A key missing at copy time is recorded in `missing_blobs` and the
backup completes with warnings: the database and every other blob are still a
valid recovery point. Any other read error fails the backup.

## Destinations

`backup.Destination` is the seam for every destination: put a stream, open,
list, delete a folder, probe, report local free space, and presign a
download. The one destination, `default`, is the operational store from
`blobstore.Open` on local artwork storage, the local root. On an S3 artwork
backend there is no local operational store, so there is nowhere to write
backups; the Backups page says so and links to Storage settings.

**Every API server must share the operational store.** Backups are written by
whichever server runs the task and listed, downloaded, and deleted by any
other. On a local artwork backend that is the shared-volume requirement
artwork already has in a multi-server deployment
([blob-storage.md](blob-storage.md)).

Local backups hold the same data as the database, password hashes included,
and sit in the data folder with the database's protection. Downloads are
short-lived and scoped to one object: a presigned URL where the store can
presign, or a link to `GET /api/v2/admin/backups/{id}/objects/{name}` signed
under its own capability domain (`artworkurl.NewBackupObjectSigner`) where it
cannot. A full backup downloads its objects as stored.

## Tools

`pg_dump` and `pg_restore` run on the API servers. The omnibus image carries
them with its PostgreSQL server; the regular image installs
`postgresql-client-18` from the PostgreSQL apt repository. `backup.FindTools`
prefers the newest `/usr/lib/postgresql/<major>/bin` and falls back to `PATH`.
`pg_dump`'s major version must be at least the server's: a backup checks
before dumping, and the Backups list reports a missing or older client.
Restoring needs a `pg_restore` at least as new as the `pg_dump` that wrote the
backup.

## Coordination

One cluster-wide lock covers the subsystem: a PostgreSQL session advisory lock
(`backup.SubsystemLockKey`) held on a connection of its own, opened with the
application pool's settings but outside the pool. Work under the lock takes
pool connections (the snapshot transaction, settings reads), so a lock held
on a pool connection would deadlock a pool of one. Every operation that
writes or deletes backups holds it: the nightly and manual backup, rotation,
deletion, and the sweep.

- Rotation and the sweep run inside the backup that holds the lock.
- "Back up now" takes the lock in the request and hands it to the task run it
  starts, so there is no window between the check and the backup. It and
  "Delete" answer 409 when the lock is held.
- A scheduled run that finds the lock held records
  "skipped: another backup or restore is running". Every API server fires the
  same daily trigger; one backs up and the others record the skip.
- A held lock's session is checked every 10 seconds. If it ends, the work
  holding the lock is canceled (`pg_dump`), and the
  incomplete folder it leaves is the sweep's.
- Whether the lock is held is read from `pg_locks`, never by taking it: a read
  that took the lock even briefly could make a nightly run skip.

### Status

The lock holder publishes what it is doing in the one-row `backup_status`
table, so any API server can report a run another server started: the active
operation (`backup` or `delete`), its backup id, start time, progress and
message, and, when a backup run ends, its id, kind, outcome, and error, and
for a run that succeeded its finish time as `last_success_at`, which a
failed run after it leaves alone. Lock occupancy alone says nothing about
which operation holds it.

- Status writes run on the lock's own session, serialized with its session
  check and release, and each statement requires that session to hold the
  advisory lock (`pg_locks`, `pid = pg_backend_pid()`). A publication cannot
  outlive the lock that justified it, even when its write is delayed.
- Each operation gets a token when it publishes. Its progress and end writes
  apply only while the row still carries that token, and it writes nothing
  once its lock session has ended, so a holder that lost the lock can never
  change what the next holder published.
- The row names the session holding the lock: its backend pid and start
  time. A lock session holds the lock once and is then unlocked and closed,
  so a session names one acquisition. A reader believes
  the active operation only while `pg_locks` shows that session holding the
  lock; otherwise the row describes an interrupted run, even while an
  unrelated operation holds the lock.
- The next holder, when it publishes, first records an active backup left in
  the row as the latest run, `interrupted`, with its id, kind, and start
  time, in the same statement.

## Scheduling and settings

The `backup` task runs daily at `backup.time` (server local time) and on
"Back up now". `ShouldRun` reads `backup.enabled`, so turning backups off stops
only scheduled runs. The setting owns the time: each server points the task's
trigger at it at startup and on every settings change, so an edit to the task
schedule itself does not stick. Task history records each run with its id,
status, size, duration, missing blobs, and what rotation removed.

| Key | Default | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `backup.enabled` | `true` | boolean |
| `backup.time` | `04:00` | 24-hour `HH:MM` |
| `backup.keep` | `7` | 1–60 |
| `backup.include_intro_fingerprints` | `false` | boolean |
| `backup.include_subtitles` | `true` | boolean |

An absent or invalid value takes its default, but a setting that cannot be
read fails the backup or the listing, and skips rotation with a warning. It
never falls back to the default: a failed read of `backup.keep` could rotate
away copies the admin meant to keep.

## Rotation

- Rotation runs only after a manifest is written. A failed backup never
  deletes anything, and folders without a manifest are never rotated, only
  swept.
- `nightly` and `manual` copies share `backup.keep`; older ones beyond it are
  deleted, oldest first.
- The newest `nightly` or `manual` copy without warnings is never deleted, even
  when that keeps one more than `backup.keep`, so repeated runs with missing
  blobs cannot rotate away the last copy that has every blob.
- Rotation manages only the current server id's prefix.
- Deleting a backup takes the same lock.
- A delete that fails leaves a warning in the task result.

## Full restore

Full restore is the offline `silo backup restore` command, never an API
operation. `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` come from the environment (or
`-env`); nothing comes from the database being replaced. `--from` is a backup
folder on this computer (the folder at the destination, or a downloaded copy
of its objects), read in place. `pg_restore` reads it, and nothing changes
until every check passed.

The first SIGINT or SIGTERM cancels a `silo backup` command, which stops
and cleans up before exiting, a swap's rollback included. A second signal exits at once. Once a swap's
journal exists, the first interrupt says that a second may leave the
databases closed and prints `silo backup restore --recover <time>` with the
swap's time.

A swap's cleanup (settling, rolling back, or dropping an unused restored
database) ignores the interrupt but has one 5-minute deadline for the whole
cleanup, so a statement that never returns cannot keep the databases closed
forever. When it passes, the command stops with the databases closed and
prints the journal and the `--recover` command.

Every mode first validates: the manifest is present and complete (exactly
`db.dump` and `blobs.tar`, each with a size and SHA-256; exactly the core
inventory tables, each present with a count or absent; a kind matching the
id; a valid server id), `db.dump` and `blobs.tar` match their checksums,
`blobs.tar` holds the manifest's file count, every entry is a regular file
in its store's backup namespaces, and no two entries land on the same object
(stores that share one root count as one place), the backup's goose version
is not newer than this binary's newest migration, the backup applied no
migration this binary does not carry (`database.MigrationVersions`; the
refusal names the versions), and the key check value matches. All of it runs
before anything changes. Migrations run out of order, so a database can hold
a version below the binary's newest that the binary does not have, such as
one from another branch's build; the newest-version check alone would let it
through. A manifest written before `applied_migrations` existed is checked
by its goose version alone, and the restored database's applied versions are
checked against the binary in the verification step instead. A backup taken
with another key needs `--accept-lost-credentials`: its encrypted settings and credentials cannot be
read with this key.

### Separate mode

`silo backup restore --from <backup> --into <database URL> --blobs-into <dir>`
restores into a pre-created empty database and a separate directory laid out
as a local store root, changing nothing in the live deployment. It needs no
`CREATEDB` or rename privilege. After `pg_restore --exit-on-error
--no-owner --no-privileges`, it verifies the schema version, the applied
migrations, and the table inventory against the manifest. The target stays
open for the operator to point `DATABASE_URL` and the artwork storage
settings at. `--database-only` replaces `--blobs-into` and warns that uploaded
artwork, avatars, and branding will be missing. Separate mode clears no
Redis: the live deployment may still be running on it, and which Redis a
server on the restored database will use is not known here. The command
says to run `FLUSHDB` on that Redis database, or use an empty one, before
starting Silo on the restored database.

### Swap mode: never destroy first

`silo backup restore --from <dir>` replaces the live database and restores
blobs into the live stores. Before running it the operator stops Silo on
every server and turns off automatic restarts (Compose `restart`, Kubernetes
replicas set to 0), so nothing can write blobs. The command cannot prove that,
so it refuses while any other client is connected to the live database and
closes the database as an extra guard.

1. Validate (above).
2. Preflight on a control connection to the maintenance database
   (`postgres`): no other client on the live database, `CREATEDB` and
   ownership of it (or superuser), no database already using the two names
   the swap needs, and write access to the live stores, opened from the live
   configuration. Nothing has changed yet.
3. Create `silo_restore_<time>` (the live database's encoding and libc
   locale) and `pg_restore --exit-on-error` into it.
4. Verify it: schema version, applied migrations, and inventory match the
   manifest, no applied migration is one this binary does not carry, and the
   restored settings record the storage location the live stores are. Then
   close it to connections and end the command's sessions on it.
5. Quiesce the live database: `ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false`, then end any session
   that appeared since step 2. The journal starts just before this, in
   `silo-restore-<time>.journal` in the working directory (each record
   synced, and the directory synced once the file exists, so its name
   survives a host crash; if that cannot be done the swap stops before
   closing anything) and at
   `backups/<server-id>/<time>-overwritten-blobs/journal.json`.
   Its header records both databases' OIDs and the live storage
   configuration, credentials sealed with `SECRET_KEY`.
6. Blobs, unless `--database-only`: each key the backup holds is recorded in
   the journal before it changes; one that exists is first copied to
   `backups/<server-id>/<time>-overwritten-blobs/<key>` in its own store.
7. Rename the live database to `silo_before_restore_<time>`, rename the
   restored database to the live name, and reopen it, the only database
   reopened. Each rename is recorded as intended before it runs, and whether
   it took effect is read back from `pg_database` by OID, whatever the
   statement answered. If only the reopen fails, the swap is done; the command retries
   and then prints the one statement to run.
8. The old database stays closed and the overwritten-blobs folder stays. The
   command prints how to drop them once the restored server works, or how to
   go back.
9. Clear Redis, unless `--keep-redis`: `FLUSHDB` on the database the live
   deployment is configured with (`REDIS_URL` when set, otherwise the
   `redis.url` and `redis.db` settings read from the live database before
   step 2), never `FLUSHALL`, so no server serves sessions, caches, or
   coordination state from before the restore. A deployment without Redis
   skips this. The restore has finished by now, so a Redis that cannot be
   reached or cleared does not fail it: the command warns and prints the
   `redis-cli -n <db> FLUSHDB` to run before starting Silo.

A failure in step 6, or before the second rename completes, rolls back with
connections blocked throughout and the live database reopened last:

1. undo the first rename, so the original database has the live name again;
2. put preserved blobs back and delete keys the restore added;
3. drop the restored database;
4. reopen the original database.

If a rollback step fails, the command stops with the databases closed, keeps
the restored database, the old database, the preserved blobs, and the journal,
and prints exactly which steps remain. It never reports the deployment as
unchanged unless every rollback step succeeded.
**The databases, not the journal, say how far the swap got.** A crash can
land between a rename and its journal record, so the swap and its recovery
read both databases' current names by OID: original names (nothing renamed),
the live database under the before name (first rename only), the restored
database under the live name (swapped), or the live name back with the
restored database gone (rolled back). Any other state stops with everything
closed. Every rollback step checks that state first, so running it again
after a crash is safe. A torn last journal record (a crash mid-write) is cut
off before anything is appended; damage before the last record stops
recovery.

`silo backup restore --recover <time>` reads the local journal and finishes
the swap when the databases show the second rename landed, or the rollback
otherwise. It never opens either database: the control connection reads
`pg_database`, and the blob stores are reopened from the storage
configuration in the journal, its credentials unsealed with `SECRET_KEY`.
Because it opens no database it cannot read the Redis settings, so it
clears no Redis and reminds the operator to run `FLUSHDB` if the restore
went ahead.

### Restore drills

`silo backup verify --from <backup> --scratch <database URL>` runs the
validation, restores into an empty scratch database, runs the step 4
verification (not its connection closing). The validation reads
`blobs.tar` through. It does not need the right `SECRET_KEY`; with another
one it warns that encrypted values would be lost.
CI runs the same round trip against PostgreSQL
(`TestBackupRestoreRoundTripDB`): a seeded database with blobs and an
encrypted setting is backed up, restored in separate mode, and compared
table by table, blob by blob, and by the decrypted value.

## Health

There is no server-side dashboard warning registry; the dashboard derives its
notices on the client. `GET /api/v2/admin/backups` therefore returns the
conditions the dashboard shows as `warnings`: backups turned off, no
successful backup in the last 48 hours (`no_recent_backup`): the later of
the status row's `last_success_at` and the newest complete backup at the
destination, which also covers a status row a full restore left empty; the
destination missing or unreachable, the SQLite user store, and `pg_dump`
missing or older than the server. It also carries this server's key check
value. It also returns the active operation and the latest run from
[the status row](#status).
